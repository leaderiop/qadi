### Patch Changes

- f03d75c: The remaining gaps closed in code, and one open security default decided.

  **The obligation gate is recorded.** A binding obligation nobody discharges turns
  an allow into a refusal at the enforcement boundary, so a log of decisions alone
  showed such a request as `ALLOW` while the caller received
  `UndischargedObligation`. `ObligationRecord` now reports `Discharged`,
  `HandlerFailed`, `Refused` or `NotRequired`, paired to its decision by evaluation
  id.

  Per decision, not per obligation — `ObligationHandler` receives the whole array
  and returns `void`, so which individual duty was met is not knowable without
  changing that contract, and a handler reporting falsely would be unverifiable.
  Reporting cannot change the outcome: a failing handler reports `HandlerFailed`
  and then fails unchanged.

  **Breaking**: `DecisionSinkShape.record` takes `SinkRecord`, a tagged union of
  `DecisionRecord | ObligationRecord`, because discharge happens in `Qadi.ts` after
  `evaluate` has already emitted. `DecisionRecord` gains `_tag: "Decision"`.

  **Ports say which implementation they are.** A service value was an anonymous
  object literal, so the only way to tell a fail-closed default from a real store
  was to call it and infer from the answer — an operator seeing "everything denies"
  could not see that `AttributeResolverNone` was wired. Every port Shape gains an
  optional `name`; every shipped implementation sets it, wrappers compose it
  (`"attributeResolverFromRecord (retrying)"`), and nothing branches on it.

  **Port activity is counted.** `qadi_port_calls_total` and
  `qadi_port_retries_total`. An attribute already on the subject counts nothing,
  which is the short-circuit guarantee visible as an absence. Metrics rather than
  the sink, because `MetricRegistry`'s default is memoised and therefore readable
  with zero wiring, where per-decision correlation would mean threading a collector
  through `evaluateNode` and risking INV-QD-005 for a debug view.

  **`QadiAtoms.asked()`** records the distinct questions an atom set has been
  asked. `Atom.family` keys structurally, so several `<Can>` on one policy are one
  atom; a panel keyed by component instance would invent a distinction the
  architecture does not have, and DOM highlighting is dropped rather than bought
  with a registry [AGENTS.md §13](https://github.com/leaderiop/qadi/blob/main/AGENTS.md) forbids.

  **`/__permissions` is guarded by default.** It publishes every guarded path and
  the permission each requires — a map of what to attack and where — and shipped as
  a bare `PermissionRegistryRoute` constant with no guard of its own.

  **Breaking**: that constant is replaced by
  `permissionRegistryRoute(permission, policy)`.
  `permissionRegistryRouteUnguarded(reason)` is the explicit opt-out and logs a
  warning on every request, so a local choice that reaches production is visible in
  the logs of the environment it is wrong in.

  Two things were **refused** rather than built, and the reasons are recorded: a
  cache TTL, whose natural use ("cache for five minutes") is exactly the
  backend-revocation hazard `DecisionCache`'s own documentation warns about; and
  per-obligation discharge state, above.

  Finally, every package now has a **README** — all five npm pages would have
  rendered blank — plus `homepage`, `bugs`, `engines` and keywords.
