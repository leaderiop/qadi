# @qadi/promise

## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- Resolved all 202 findings from a full-codebase audit (2026-09-06), plus the two follow-up human-decision items it surfaced. Correctness fixes, spec-consistency corrections, and hardening spanning every package — no single public API change dominates; see the merged PRs (#28-#32) for the itemized findings.
- Resolved all 191 Low/Info findings from a second full-codebase audit (2026-09-07, issue #49), including several genuine correctness fixes surfaced along the way:
  - `Neq` now denies whenever either resolved operand is `undefined` (including the both-absent case), matching `Eq`'s existing fail-closed stance — previously matched on one side being absent (H2).
  - `projectAt` (`FieldPath.ts`) walks an explicit stack instead of the call stack, closing a stack-overflow on deeply-nested field specs.
  - The untrusted-decode depth guard is now shared between `Policy.ts` and `SinkCodec.ts` (H6), and the circuit breaker releases its probe claim on abnormal exit (H4).
  - `predicate-prisma`'s compiler constant-folds vacuous AND/OR identities so they never nest (C1); `predicate-sql`/`predicate-prisma` guard non-finite bounds so both interpreters agree.
  - `DecisionCache`'s coalesced-waiter interruption path was closed; its `maxDepth` key issue was confirmed already fixed.

  Also: spec-consistency sweeps across every behavior/invariant/traceability document, gate-blind-spot closures (dod-table, api-surface, doc-examples, mutation-upload), and house-style/BDD cleanup.

- Effect built-in adoption sweep (`packages/core` and downstream consumers), each replacing a hand-rolled equivalent: `EvaluationServicesNone` is now actually used at its ~37 call sites instead of being hand-retyped; `Effect.provideService` replaces `currentSubjectLayer` construction on the per-request path; `Schema.Finite`/`Schema.is` tighten `Predicate.ts`'s bounds and `isSecurityLabel`; `Array.dedupeWith`/`groupBy`, `Record.fromIterableWith`, `Struct.omit` replace hand-rolled equivalents in `Obligation.ts`/`Gates.ts`/`Pairing.ts`/`Permission.ts`/`Edits.ts`; `Metric.frequency`'s `preregisteredWords` option is now set on the frequencies that lacked it, and the circuit breaker's state is a tagged frequency instead of a 0/1/2 gauge; `resetTimeoutMs` is `Duration.Input`; `toWire`'s per-record encode uses `Schema.encodeSync` where the input is provably total.

  **Behavior change**: `decideSubjects`/`filterSubjects` (`SubjectSet.ts`) now use `Effect.partition` and never fail outright — a subject whose evaluation breaks is reported in a `failures` array instead of discarding every other subject's decision in the batch. `Qadi.filter`'s enforcement-path semantics are unchanged (still fail-fast, per `@qadi/promise`'s own contract and INV-QD-006).

### Patch Changes

- Smaller fixes and consolidation rounding out this release:
  - `@qadi/audit`'s `encodeAuditEntry` now guards the whole record (`isRecordJsonSafe`) instead of `resource` alone — a circular or `BigInt`-valued `HasCustom.params` previously sailed past the guard and threw uncaught at the store write.
  - `@qadi/react`'s `Hydration.ts` now decodes with `UNTRUSTED_DECODE_OPTIONS`, refusing an excess property on a dehydrated entry or its embedded policy instead of silently stripping it.
  - `SinkCodec.ts`'s `toWire`/`fromWire`/`isRecordJsonSafe` dispatch is now `Match.tagsExhaustive` instead of a ternary/`if` chain — a third `SinkRecord` tag is now a compile error instead of a silent fall-through.
  - Five hand-built one-shot test gates now use `Latch`; `TestClock.testClockWith` replaces a cast-requiring fixture pattern; five duplicated `CollectingTracer` test helpers are consolidated into one shared `@qadi/testing` implementation.
  - The docs' flagship error-handling example now uses `Effect.catchTag` instead of `_tag ===` narrowing.

### Patch Changes

- f03d75c: The remaining gaps closed in code, and one open security default decided.

  **The obligation gate is recorded.** A binding obligation nobody discharges turns
  an allow into a refusal at the enforcement boundary, so a log of decisions alone
  showed such a request as `ALLOW` while the caller received
  `UndischargedObligation`. `ObligationRecord` now reports `Discharged`,
  `HandlerFailed`, `Refused` or `NotRequired`, paired to its decision by evaluation
  id.

  Per decision, not per obligation — `ObligationHandler` receives the whole array
  and returns `void`, so which individual duty was met is not knowable without
  changing that contract, and a handler reporting falsely would be unverifiable.
  Reporting cannot change the outcome: a failing handler reports `HandlerFailed`
  and then fails unchanged.

  **Breaking**: `DecisionSinkShape.record` takes `SinkRecord`, a tagged union of
  `DecisionRecord | ObligationRecord`, because discharge happens in `Qadi.ts` after
  `evaluate` has already emitted. `DecisionRecord` gains `_tag: "Decision"`.

  **Ports say which implementation they are.** A service value was an anonymous
  object literal, so the only way to tell a fail-closed default from a real store
  was to call it and infer from the answer — an operator seeing "everything denies"
  could not see that `AttributeResolverNone` was wired. Every port Shape gains an
  optional `name`; every shipped implementation sets it, wrappers compose it
  (`"attributeResolverFromRecord (retrying)"`), and nothing branches on it.

  **Port activity is counted.** `qadi_port_calls_total` and
  `qadi_port_retries_total`. An attribute already on the subject counts nothing,
  which is the short-circuit guarantee visible as an absence. Metrics rather than
  the sink, because `MetricRegistry`'s default is memoised and therefore readable
  with zero wiring, where per-decision correlation would mean threading a collector
  through `evaluateNode` and risking INV-QD-005 for a debug view.

  **`QadiAtoms.asked()`** records the distinct questions an atom set has been
  asked. `Atom.family` keys structurally, so several `<Can>` on one policy are one
  atom; a panel keyed by component instance would invent a distinction the
  architecture does not have, and DOM highlighting is dropped rather than bought
  with a registry [AGENTS.md §13](https://github.com/leaderiop/qadi/blob/main/AGENTS.md) forbids.

  **`/__permissions` is guarded by default.** It publishes every guarded path and
  the permission each requires — a map of what to attack and where — and shipped as
  a bare `PermissionRegistryRoute` constant with no guard of its own.

  **Breaking**: that constant is replaced by
  `permissionRegistryRoute(permission, policy)`.
  `permissionRegistryRouteUnguarded(reason)` is the explicit opt-out and logs a
  warning on every request, so a local choice that reaches production is visible in
  the logs of the environment it is wrong in.

  Two things were **refused** rather than built, and the reasons are recorded: a
  cache TTL, whose natural use ("cache for five minutes") is exactly the
  backend-revocation hazard `DecisionCache`'s own documentation warns about; and
  per-obligation discharge state, above.

  Finally, every package now has a **README** — all five npm pages would have
  rendered blank — plus `homepage`, `bugs`, `engines` and keywords.
